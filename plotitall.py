"""Desired goal: A script which takes in any formatted data filename 
and a format specification, then produces a generic plot of that 
data with colors and symbols."""

#TODO: Verify these comments form the algorithm you'd like to use.
#TODO: Mentally test this algo

#Read format specifier

#Using the format specifier, line-by-line add the data to column variables

#Use the format specifier to decipher the file contents and split into columns

#Have matplotlib plot the data, with the x and y functions given in the format specifier
#Write the plot to the output file specified
